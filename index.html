        <h2>About Athena</h2>
        <p>
          Athena Devika joined our family in 2019, just under a year after my husband and I got married.
          We adopted her as a birthday gift for my husband, but she quickly became my sidekick and best friend.
          She's a German Shepherd and Rottweiler mix — with the strong build and deep red coat of a Rottweiler,
          and the expressive face and silky hair of a Shepherd. Her floppy ears perk up when she’s alert, and
          it’s the cutest thing you’ll ever see.

      <h2>Adventures with Athena</h2>
      <p>
        Before I had kids and ran out of car space, Athena went everywhere with me. Together, we’ve explored
        Seattle, Oregon, and Idaho — including a wild storm we braved through Grants Pass, Oregon. Through it all,
        she was my rock, my calm through the chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        She’s run and walked miles beside me while I trained for Army endurance tests, proving time and again
        what an amazing, loyal, and strong companion she is. Despite her intimidating bark and stance when
        she senses danger, Athena has never done more than bark. Usually, she greets people with a powerful
        tail wag that sways her whole body!

      <h2>Her Quirky Side</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>She’s the best cuddle bug, often sleeping in awkward “C” shapes with her legs up.</li>
        <li>Once, we thought we lost her — turns out, she was just in a deep sleep under our bed, wrapped in a blanket!</li>
        <li>She’s our family favorite, loved by everyone.</li>
        <li>Now that she’s older, her snout is graying, but her spirit is as youthful as ever.</li>
