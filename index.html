            <h2>About Athena</h2>
            <p>Athena Devika is our loyal and loving German Shepherd–Rottweiler mix. We adopted her in 2019 when she was just a four-month-old puppy—a birthday gift for my husband that quickly became my constant companion. With the strong build and deep red coloring of a Rottweiler and the soulful face and fur of a German Shepherd, she’s the perfect blend of both breeds. Her floppy ears perk up when she’s curious or on alert—it’s the cutest thing!</p>

            <h2>Our Journey Together</h2>
            <p>Athena has been part of our lives since just after my husband and I got married. Before I had kids and ran out of space in my car, she went *everywhere* with me. Together, we’ve explored Seattle, Oregon, and Idaho. She even traveled through a bad storm in Grants Pass, Oregon—her calm strength kept me grounded through it all.</p>
            <p>She’s also been my running partner, keeping pace with me through miles of Army endurance test training. No matter the distance, she was always ready with boundless energy and her signature wagging tail that could move mountains (or at least the couch cushions).</p>

            <h2>Personality & Quirks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heart of Gold:</strong> She’s gentle, affectionate, and fiercely loyal.</li>
                <li><strong>Protective Yet Playful:</strong> Her bark might sound tough, but her tail wag gives her away every time.</li>
                <li><strong>Legendary Sleeper:</strong> Known for sleeping in the most awkward angles—legs up, twisted like a C, sometimes half under the bed.</li>
                <li><strong>Growing Older, Not Slower:</strong> She’s starting to gray around her snout but still has that same puppy energy and sparkle in her eyes.</li>
            </ul>
